# Mnemo

A command-line helper for memorising short texts, like poetry.

Add some `.txt` files to `~/.mnemo/texts` & `cargo run`.

[More details on my blog](https://www.sebstrug.com/code/mnemo/)

Use it from command line with just 'mnemo' by downloading the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/SebStrug/mnemo/releases) and copying it to `/usr/local/bin`
